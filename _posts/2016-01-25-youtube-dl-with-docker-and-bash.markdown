I finally took some time recently to cobble together a set of bash scripts to allow me to download local copies of videos from youtube, heavily piggy backing off the [jbergknoff/youtube-dl](https://hub.docker.com/r/jbergknoff/youtube-dl/) Docker image and the associated [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) project.

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/e0y1g6y8xvmj9u93zwrldkqnb.js" id="asciicast-e0y1g6y8xvmj9u93zwrldkqnb" async></script>

You can add the following bash functions to your own env files (I've a post on my own setup in the works).

{% gist 714abb85af1e691e58a5 docker.fn.sh %}
{% gist 714abb85af1e691e58a5 utils.fn.sh %}
{% gist 714abb85af1e691e58a5 youtube-dl.fn.sh %}

Then assuming you have Docker running you can download a Youtube video as follows:

```
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPsu4OH9hsk ~/brooklyn-gource.mp4
```

You can omit the target file and it will download to `./video.mp4`.
