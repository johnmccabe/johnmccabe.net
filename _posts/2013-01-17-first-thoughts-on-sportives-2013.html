<p>Its getting close to the time of year where excuses for not being out on the bike disappear, best start thinking about Sportives. Heres the list thats been circulated around our regular group, the bangor coastal and maracycle are shaping up to the ones most of us attend. I'm going to try to repeat last years aim of getting to at least one a fortnight, so will have to start checking out more of the events down south and perhaps over the water, I've got the bike bag now so better use it.</p>
