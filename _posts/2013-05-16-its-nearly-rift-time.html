<p>Been waiting patiently for this since last year and its about to ship, can't wait to get to try it at long last. I've already got the schedule planned for what I'll be checking out - Tuscany, Rift Coaster, and International Space Station Demos followed by some Skyrim and Half Life 2. #futureofentertainment</p>
